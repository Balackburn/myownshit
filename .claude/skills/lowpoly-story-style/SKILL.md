name: lowpoly-story-style
description: Make a vertical low-poly 3D story short in one pass, in the measured style of the "man lost his dog in a tornado" reference (the tornado replica): deadpan narration with no pauses, a cut every 1-2 s, low moving cameras, bright sky and pastel sets, snappy characters with lip flaps and blinks, pop-in signs, the replica's captions and title-card spring, a music bed and effects on the actions, mixed to -16 LUFS. Use it to remake an existing short (script from a video) or to produce a new story in this style, in French or English, with the absurd-shorts engine and HyperFrames.

# Low-poly story shorts in the tornado style (one pass)

Everything here was measured on the reference over 50+ replica passes (`hyperframes/01-tornado-reverse/REVERSE.md`,
`.claude/skills/tesseract-replica/references/lessons.md`) and proven on a full remake (`hyperframes/02-vos-papiers`).
Follow the numbers; don't re-derive them.

Read, in this order:
1. `references/style-bible.md`: what the style is, in numbers (pacing, cameras, palette, grade, characters, captions, cards, sound).
2. `references/shot-library.md`: the shot types with engine snippets (copy, then adapt the coordinates).
3. `references/production.md`: the one-pass pipeline, command by command, with the QA gates.
4. `references/pitfalls.md`: what went wrong on the first stills of a new story and how to avoid it.
5. `references/sand3d-models.md`: when the engine lacks an object, search the sand3d datasets (about 100 000 objects as programs,
- `references/faces-and-fx.md`: every character wears the hero's face with variations (glasses, moustache, beard, lipstick, skin tone), 56 expressions, automatic micro-animation, face FX (wet hair and drops, tears, sweat, blush, shiver) and FLUX-generated textures. Give every beat a playing expression and use FX whenever the situation calls for it (rain = wet).
   CC BY 4.0), build a GLB and use it with the `glbModel` prop.

Rules that always apply:
- The ElevenLabs key lives only in the environment (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`), never in a file, a commit or this skill. Use the narrator
  voice configured in the project (`absurd-shorts/scripts-fr/actu_common.py`, `VOICE`): one voice for narration and quotes, quotes
  with the expressive settings. Never imitate a real person's voice.
- Satire: aim at the absurd institution or at the prejudice, never make an ethnicity the butt of the joke.
- Use music only from sources the person owns or a licence allows (here: the separated bed of their own reference film). Never
  download copyrighted music.
- Commit sources, the timeline, the final mix and the 3D layer the composition needs; never `out/`, `renders/` or the TTS cache.
- A missing object: search sand3d first (`references/sand3d-models.md`), model by hand only when nothing fits. Run dataset programs only
  through `sand3d_models.py build` (it refuses anything but sand3d calls), and keep their CC BY 4.0 credits with the story.

Scripts (in `scripts/`, run with `python3`):
- `place_narration.py LINES.json TTS_DIR OUT.json [--atempo 1.08]`: back-to-back placement and word timings.
- `build_hf.py TIMELINE.json PROJECT_DIR --cards "A04:AGRESSION,..."`: the captions composition and title cards.
- `mix.py`: voice + music bed loop + effect cues to a -16 LUFS mix (edit the cue list per story).
- `motion.py REF.mp4 OURS.mp4 OUTDIR`: residual (non-camera) motion per shot, to find shots that freeze.
- `sand3d_models.py find|search|get|build|credits`: find a ready-made 3D object in the sand3d datasets, build it to a GLB (in a
  checked, isolated process) and credit it; see `references/sand3d-models.md`.
